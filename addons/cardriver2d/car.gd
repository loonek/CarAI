## The Car class has a script attached to it that can move something roughly resembling an actual car.[br]
## The way you use it is to simply attach a mesh or sprite to the car and give it a collider and there you go![br]
## If you have any questions or something is broken, go to the GitHub repository for this project and start a discussion in the 'Issues' tab.[br][br]

## Manages the speed of the car. The higher it is, the faster the car is.
@export var acceleration_factor: float = 1.0
## Manages the break speed of the car. The higher it is, the faster the car decelerates from a velocity higher than 0.
@export var break_speed: float = 1.0
## Holds the maximum speed of the car. Remember - as of now, max speed is always slightly overshot because the code isn't as clean yet, but that will likely change in the future.
@export var max_speed: float = 300.0
## Manages the maximum turn strength of the car. The current turn strength of the car is highest at the speed 300 (or also, because of Godot's inverted y axis, it's -300).		
@export var turn_strength: float = 2.0
## This number is the velocity at which the car turns the best. At default, the best turning speed for the car is 300. This, of course, can be changed.
@export var most_ideal_turn_speed: float = 250.0
## With this varible, you can decide if you want Particles or not. If you want to not have it toggle-able, but rather not have particles at all, simply delete the [code]exhaust_particles.tres[/code].
